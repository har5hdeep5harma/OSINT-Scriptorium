- Sock puppets aren’t exclusive to deception operations, they can also be used for privacy and OPSEC for an investigator, journalist, penetration tester, etc.  OPSEC online not only protects the investigator, but it also protects the target in the case that the evidence provided leads nowhere.

The Art Of The Sock is a long term game, if only because there is nothing that screams sock like a freshly coined social media account. This means that you have to think long term when it comes to growing a fully fleshed out sock account, you have to start growing and nurturing them a long time before you will actually need them.

The first thing you have to do is clearly define your intent.  You can choose to create a fake persona or you can create an avatar that’s clearly fake with the masked excuse of OPSEC as it’s origin.  Let me elaborate.  Let’s say you choose option 1.  You want to create a sock puppet named “Eugene Shoemaker”.  Eugene Shoemaker doesn’t exist.  So you have to create an entire identity around Gene in order for the account to look authentic. This takes a very long time, is very difficult, and has a higher chance of failure.  Additionally, if this sock is discovered, all of your work has to be deleted and you have to start all over again.  If you can pull this off, this is the most effective way to operate.  But not everyone is patient.  That’s why there’s option 2.

Option 2 is creating an avatar that’s focused around an idea rather than a unique identity.  Examples of this include @ShakiraSecurity on X.  Everyone knows Shakira isn’t involved in the infosec community.  They also know that that account isn’t Shakira.  But that account is still a trusted source on X when it comes to OSINT and infosec conversations.  That account have over 6000 followers.  That account has a function and has built trust.  That account was easier to create than a blank slate.

For both options it’s recommended to create content, add media (photos, videos), interact with others online in an authentic way, create multiple social profiles, convince others to vouch for you, have a phone number, unique IP, email address, etc.

Within dark rooms in foreign corners of the world, ‘sock master’ is actually a real job description and people devote their working days to growing and nurturing sock accounts to hand off to others for use in information warfare campaigns. To call them all sock masters though would be a lie, most of them are sock herders at best and if you watch closely, you can see the handovers in the socks behavior.

# The Setup

You need:
1. A dedicated computer that is only used for investigations 
2. Encrypted Email – Use Proton Mail 
3. A burner phone number (expensive) or a wifi phone number (cheap or free) 
4. A social media profile where your target is most active (choose option 1 or 2) 
5. A couple different virtual machines 
6. A blog or website (you can use a free blog like WordPress, Blogger, or Medium) 
7. A VPN (you should probably have one anyway)
Now, this is just a start, but it will help you at least get started.  You will have to customize your avatar as you go along to maintain or add credibility

# Things to Consider 

It’s important to remember that you should be very careful before deploying your sock puppet.  If you use it too soon, you’ll lose credibility with your target or associates and you may not recover.  I recommend setting goals such as a certain number of Tweets, followers, blog posts, or months, etc. before creating plan to use it.  With that being said, the intent of your sock puppet should be dictated by the influence it creates organically.  Don’t steer your sock puppet in an unnatural direction.  Let it grow organically and deploy it in the direction it develops on it’s own.  That’s why it’s important to have multiple accounts. 

Another thing to consider is forensic linguistics.  Try to make the content you create on your sock puppet account as unique as possible (or at least different from your personal account). That being said, so long as you’re not doing anything incredibly controversial, people won’t question your motives and investigate your identity anyway. Constantly collect OSINT on your sock puppet and reverse engineer your own creation.

# Anti-Sock Tech

Machine learning tools have been created which can detect if two accounts are owned by the same person with 91% accuracy. There are other tools that can distinguish between a real social account and a sock with 68% accuracy.

Tools like these are spotting patterns across thousands of social accounts and identifying their owners with ever increasing accuracy, they find patterns in your behavior and develop a behavioral fingerprint that you subconsciously leave on your actions. Even though you may try to randomize your behavioral patterns, style of writing, manner of expression, login times, IP address and other ways to conceal yourself, you cannot hide if the algorithms are given enough historical data on your activities to analyze. We all have our own unique behavioral fingerprint. 

These tools are being developed in an effort to counter information warfare efforts across social media operations conducted against us by foreign adversaries intent on influencing the conversation in our society. They are also being developed by the private sector and the social media platforms themselves in an effort to disrupt trolls, persistent abusers, and operations designed to spread fake news into our feeds.

Its getting much easier to spot and identify even the most experienced sock operators, especially when they are engaged in shady online behavior. But a skilled OSINT investigator who maintains his or her own sock accounts for investigative purposes, and who takes care, is likely to fly under their radar completely.
