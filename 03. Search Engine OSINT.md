## Search Engine Operators

**Search operators** are commands that use special characters along with a query to make the search engine results more specific. Essentially, they work like filters that you can customize as needed.

To use a search operator, add the command into the search box and search as you normally would. The results are entirely different from the average search.

SEOs routinely use search operators to filter results from a search engine. These advanced search skills let you easily:

- Locate something specific online
- Research a site you’re optimizing
- Investigate the competitive field

When you get comfortable with a few of these commands, you can find what you’re looking for much faster.

>A search operator typically has:
>
> -  A prefix: Something that comes before the search query
> -  An addition: Something that is appended to the search query and contains special characters

### Quotation Marks

Quotation marks (“) help you to match an exact phrase. So searching for “advanced search tips” as an example (with the quotes) finds only pages that contain those words used as a phrase.

### Site Search

The site: command filters your search results to just one website. In other words: You are searching only one domain for the information you need.

Start with the command, which is site: then add the domain name you want to search and finally the topic you want to search the domain for.

>You can combine search operators to refine results even further. For example, you can combine site search with quotation marks to search for a longer phrase within a particular website.

## Search Operators Used in SEO Research

Here are seven ways to use the search commands for SEO research:

1. Analyze the competition
2. Find information about a specific page or site
3. Discover indexing problems
4. Help with site maintenance
5. Further refine results
6. Find social profiles
7. Find potential internal links
