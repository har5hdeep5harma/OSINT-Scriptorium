## Physical Location OSINT

Physical Location OSINT can be performed with satellite maps, street view and vlogs available (if any), for that location. Checking posts by different users on various Social Media platforms can give a glimpse into the trend, weather, etc. around that place.

Some worth noticeable things in the images to be analyzed are signboards, buildings/shops names, flags, number plates of vehicles (if any) and other such subtle details.

Many times, intuition can perform wonders.
Considering Social Media Uploads of the subject and many details that may seem irrelevant initially, like weather in photos, subject's activity status on various platforms, etc. could be the codebreaker.
