## Manual Investigation Techniques

### 1. **Google Dorking**

```text
"username" site:twitter.com
"username" site:reddit.com
"username" filetype:pdf
inurl:"username"
```

Use variations: `"username"`, `username123`, `"@username"`

### 2. **Email Discovery**
- Try common email formats: `username@gmail.com`, `username@yahoo.com`
- Use tools like:
  - [Hunter.io](https://hunter.io)
  - [Emailrep.io](https://emailrep.io)
  - [HaveIBeenPwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com)

### 3. **Reverse Image Search**
- Use profile pictures from discovered accounts
  - Google Images
  - Yandex
  - TinEye

### 4. **Avatar or Username as Hash**
- Use Levenshtein Distance for fuzzy username variations
- Check for reused avatars across platforms (hash match)

## Investigation Workflow

1. **Collect Base Username**
   - Variants: lowercase, underscores, dots, numbers
   - e.g., `john.doe`, `john_doe`, `john123`

2. **Run Automated Tools**
   - Sherlock/Maigret to get first map of online presence

3. **Manual Deep Dive**
   - Log into platforms to see private or soft-deleted accounts
   - Look for:
     - Bio info (location, job)
     - Posts or photos revealing habits, interests, or friends

4. **Cross-Platform Linking**
   - Same profile pic, banner, bio language
   - Link behavior: Same posting style, emojis, grammar

5. **Pivot Points**
   - Emails, usernames, images, friend list, tags

6. **Logging & Documentation**
   - Take screenshots
   - Export results to CSV/JSON
   - Store links, dates, and changes over time
